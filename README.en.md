## Introduction✨

Inspired by [@Multi_Serio_Ai](https://x.com/Multi_Serio_Ai/status/2100800237619347535)'s [Grokbot Icon Studio prompt page](https://grokbot-icon-studio.serio-ai.chatgpt.site/), we created Erika.

Erika generates banners for GitHub repositories. She combines your project illustration, name, description, and stats into one image. Add a URL to your README to display it.

Use your own illustration, a GitHub avatar, or Erika's built-in illustration. Adjust the style in the Playground, then copy the Markdown. You can also generate images with scheduled GitHub Actions and save them to your repository.

## Features🪄

- **Repository information**: Read the name, description, stars, forks, open issues and pull requests, and latest release from public repositories.
- **Illustrations and avatars**: Use repository images, GitHub avatars, or built-in illustrations with two layout templates.
- **Text layout**: Support Chinese and English, line wrapping, automatic font sizing, and truncation for long text.
- **Appearance**: Choose light or dark themes, image cropping, circular masks, and WebP or PNG output.
- **Live preview**: Share settings through a URL. Copy Markdown, a dual-theme `<picture>`, or an image URL.
- **Deployment**: Use Vercel, Docker, or GitHub Actions without a running server.

## Quick start🚀

Start with a GrokBot Icon style image.

<details>
<summary>No GrokBot Icon yet? Here is how to create one</summary>

1. Visit [Grokbot Icon Studio, created by @Multi_Serio_Ai](https://grokbot-icon-studio.serio-ai.chatgpt.site/en), to create an illustration for your project. Alongside the supplied prompt, describe your project or attach an anime character reference associated with your project or personal account.

2. Optionally, generate a version without a background for switching between light and dark themes.

3. Save the illustration in your project's `assets/` directory as `grokbot-icon.png` (or a compressed `.webp`). Name the transparent version `erika-icon-transparent.png`, if you have one.

</details>

Open the [Playground](https://erika.snowy.moe/?uiLang=en). Enter Owner and Repo, adjust the icon, text, and theme, then copy the generated Markdown, URL, or HTML.

You can also add this to your README. Replace `Moemu/Erika` with your public repository:

```markdown
![Project banner](https://erika.snowy.moe/v1/banner/Moemu/Erika.webp)
```

<details>
<summary>Follow GitHub's light and dark themes</summary>

Use `<picture>` to specify an image for each theme:

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="https://erika.snowy.moe/v1/banner/Moemu/Erika.webp?theme=dark" />
  <img alt="Project banner" src="https://erika.snowy.moe/v1/banner/Moemu/Erika.webp?theme=light" />
</picture>
```

</details>

Now open your Markdown editor and take a look. Ciallo～(∠・ω< )⌒☆

## Parameters⚙️

### Project icon

Without an explicit icon path, Erika checks these files on the target repository's default branch, in order. If none work, she uses the built-in illustration:

```text
assets/grokbot-icon.webp
assets/grokbot-icon.png
assets/grokbot-icon.jpg
```

Use query parameters to change the source or display:

| Usage | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `?iconPath=assets/my-icon.webp` | Use the specified image from the repository's default branch, with a relative path |
| `?icon=avatar` | Use the repository owner's GitHub user or organization avatar |
| `?icon=builtin` | Use Erika's built-in illustration |
| `?icon=avatar&iconFit=cover&iconRound=1` | Use a circular avatar that fills the icon area |

Use transparent PNG or WebP for illustrations shared across light and dark themes. The service preserves image pixels. It does not remove backgrounds or change character colors.

### Layout templates

| Template | Suitable images | Layout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `grokbot` | Project illustrations with background space | Try to blend the illustration background with the banner background |
| `avatar` | Avatars or logos | Place the image in a separate area with space between the image and text |

The default template is `grokbot`. Setting `icon=avatar` automatically selects `avatar`. You can also specify the template in the URL:

```text
https://erika.snowy.moe/v1/banner/Moemu/Erika/avatar.webp?icon=avatar
```

### Text and repository information

The title and description come from GitHub by default. Override them with `title` and `description`. Encode spaces, Chinese characters, and special characters in URLs. Use the Playground to enter text and copy an encoded URL.

`meta` controls which repository fields appear. For example, show only stars and the latest release:

```text
https://erika.snowy.moe/v1/banner/Moemu/Erika.webp?meta=stars,release
```

Omit `meta` to use the template's default fields. Set `?meta=` to hide all repository information fields.

Grokbot and Avatar also support `license`, `language`, and `last_updated`. Select them in the Playground or use `?meta=license,language,last_updated`. The defaults remain repository name, Star, Fork, Issue, and Release.

`license` shows the SPDX identifier recognized by GitHub. Unrecognized licenses are omitted. `language` shows the primary language. `last_updated` uses the repository's `pushed_at` and displays the UTC date as `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Use `**…**` to highlight text in descriptions, such as `?description=An **event-loop** chatbot`.

### Other parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `theme` | `light` / `dark`. When omitted, colors follow the illustration background. Explicit themes control the background and text colors. Illustrations blend in or use rounded corners, depending on transparency and background compatibility. |
| `accent` | `auto` detects an artwork color and adjusts it for readability; `#RRGGBB` uses the exact color (encode `#` as `%23` in URLs). Omit to keep the preset or template accent. |
| `icon` | `auto` / `avatar` / `builtin`; default: `auto` |
| `iconPath` | Relative image path within the repository, up to 128 characters |
| `iconFit` | `contain` keeps the full image; `cover` fills the area and crops the image |
| `iconRound` | `1` enables a circular mask; `0` disables it |
| `title` | Override the title, up to 25 characters. The layout can display this length in full. |
| `description` | Override the description, up to 180 characters. Text that exceeds the layout capacity at the minimum 0.75 font scale is truncated. |
| `meta` | Comma-separated fields: `full_name`, `stars`, `forks`, `issues`, `release`, `license`, `language`, `last_updated`. The selected template must support them. |
| `scale` | Output scale from 0.1 to 1; default: 0.5, producing a 1500 × 900 image |
| `lang` | Error placeholder language: `en` / `zh`; default: `en` |
| `fresh` | `fresh=1` uses `Cache-Control: no-cache` so image proxies validate with the origin. GitHub data still follows the Provider cache lifetime. |

Automatic detection ignores transparent pixels, detected backdrops, and neutral colors. It selects a hue by area and saturation, then adjusts brightness for readability. If no suitable color exists, it keeps the preset or template accent. The `X-Banner-Accent` response header reports the final color. CLI commands `render` and `render-live` also accept `--accent auto` or `--accent "#8B65B5"`.


## Deployment📦

| Method | Suitable use | How it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vercel | Live preview and a dynamic API | Static frontend hosting with a function-based API |
| GitHub Actions | README images without maintaining an online service | Generate images on a schedule and commit them to the repository |
| Docker | An existing container environment that you manage | One container serves the Playground and API |

### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMoemu%2FErika&project-name=erika&env=GITHUB_TOKEN)

1. Deploy with the button above, or fork the repository and import it into Vercel.
2. Set the project root to the repository root. Keep the repository's build configuration.
3. Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` to a token with read-only access to public repositories.
4. Open the site homepage to preview, or visit `/v1/banner/:owner/:repo.webp`.

### GitHub Actions

1. Copy the [workflow example](docs/examples/refresh-banner.yml) to `.github/workflows/refresh-banner.yml` in your repository.
2. Update `BANNER_OWNER`, `BANNER_REPO`, `BANNER_TEMPLATE`, and `BANNER_OUT`.
3. Enable the workflow on your repository's Actions page, then run it manually once.
4. Reference the generated file in your README, for example: `![Project banner](assets/banner.webp)`.

The example runs hourly. It makes no commit when the image is unchanged. It uses GitHub's automatic `GITHUB_TOKEN` and needs `contents: write` permission to commit images.

`ERIKA_REF` follows `main` by default. Set a verified commit SHA or release tag to pin the tool version. Scheduled runs may be delayed. Images update when the run finishes.

### Docker

Clone the repository, copy the environment example, and set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moemu/Erika.git
cd Erika
cp .env.example .env
```

Build and start the service:

```bash
docker build -t erika:local .
docker run -d --name erika -p 8787:8787 --env-file .env erika:local
```

Open `http://localhost:8787` to use the Playground. The API uses the same address.

To customize project presets, edit the [preset configuration](apps/api/presets/presets.json) before building the image. Alternatively, mount a directory containing `presets.json` read-only at `/app/apps/api/presets`. Presets load at startup. Restart the container after changing mounted files.

## Other API endpoints🧪

| Request | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/banner/:owner/:repo.webp` | Generate a WebP banner; change the extension to `.png` for PNG |
| `GET /v1/banner/:owner/:repo/:template.webp` | Generate a banner with a specific template |
| `GET /v1/meta` | List templates, themes, supported fields, and parameter limits |
| `GET /doc` | Get the OpenAPI description |
| `GET /healthz` | Check service health |

## Local development🛠️

Use Node.js 22 or later and the pnpm version specified in the project's `packageManager` field.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Moemu/Erika.git
cd Erika
pnpm install
pnpm build
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env`. This project reads only public repositories, so the token needs only public information read access. A classic PAT can have no scopes selected. A fine-grained token can use read-only public repository access. See [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/scopes-for-oauth-apps) for permissions.

Start the API and Playground in separate terminals:

```bash
pnpm dev:api
```

```bash
pnpm --filter @erika/playground dev
```

The Playground runs at `http://localhost:5173`, and the API runs at `http://localhost:8787`. The development preview forwards API requests to the backend.

### CLI usage

Run this command from the repository root to read GitHub data and save an image:

```bash
node packages/cli/dist/cli.js render-live --owner Moemu --repo Erika --out out/banner.webp
```

You can also render Erika's own banner. The output is saved in `out/`:

```bash
pnpm render:erika
```

### Changes and validation

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck:vercel
```

`pnpm test` includes unit tests, API tests, and visual regression. Start in the [template directory](packages/templates/) to add templates. The API is in `apps/api`, the preview is in `apps/playground`, the renderer is in `packages/core`, and GitHub data access is in `packages/providers`.

After building the image, run the container smoke test:

```bash
docker build -t erika:local .
node scripts/smoke-docker.mjs erika:local
```

The container smoke test checks page assets, banner rendering, cache responses, and error placeholders through real HTTP routes. It uses a fixed upstream without accessing real GitHub.

To extract layers and text styles from PSD files, see the [PSD toolkit guide](packages/psd-toolkit/README.md).

## About🎗️

Erika（絵里香）is a banner girl who paints portraits for repositories. The project started with manually arranged PSD covers. It turns those introductions into a URL-configured service that updates with repository data.
